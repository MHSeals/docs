if you're new here and don't know where to start, check out the [ros2](./ros2.md) and [setting up your workspace](setting_up_your_workspace.md) pages.

## problems (and hopefully, solutions)
1. we want to connect all of our hardware together have have a platform for all of them to communication to each other!
	* solution: [ros2](./ros2.md)
2. taking out our boat every time we want to test code is such a pain!
	* solution: [gazebo](gazebo.md) and [vrx](vrx.md).
### the navigation issue
1. use relative coordinates to build a map relative to our boat -- [slam_toolbox](slam_toolbox.md)
2. use our lidar to calculate odometry -- [kiss_icp](kiss_icp.md)
3. profit?
