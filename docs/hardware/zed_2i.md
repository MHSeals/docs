# Zed 2i

The Zed 2i is a new camera replacing our outdated Realsense cameras. It is designed to work outside and provides high-resolution stereo vision for depth perception and 3D mapping.
It also runs our computer vision model, providing real-time 3d bounding boxes for objects in the camera's field of view.
